# PBJ_New
PBJ Project (Proto Board with Jacks) -- For Synthesizer hardware development
This project provides KiCAD files used to fab PBJ synthesizer development breadboards.
It requires the KiCAD libraries found at: https://github.com/shannon-greenlight/KiCAD
Currently, only the PBJ EU is available. But a standalone version, the PBJ Solo, is in the wings.
