# PBJ_New
PBJ Project (Proto Board with Jacks) -- For Synthesizer hardware development
This project provides the KiCAD files used to fab PBJ synthesizer development breadboards.
It requires the KiCAD libraries found at: https://github.com/shannon-greenlight/KiCAD
Currently, only the PBJ EU is available. But a standalone version, the PBJ Solo, is in the wings.

Note: If you don't have KiCAD and just want to make the PBJ, you can send the Gerber files to fab and use the Excel file to buy the parts. 
The jpeg of the schematic can be used for reference.
